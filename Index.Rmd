## Summary

In this tutorial we will discuss:

* What Travis CI is and how it works

* We will demonstrate two methods for adding Travis CI to a GitHub repo that does not contain a package - so in our case our repo contains an .rmd and we want to test if it renders

    1) We will show how this process can be done manually, (this helps demonstrate what other packages that make this process faster actually do)
    
    2) We will show a shorter version of the process using the [usethis](https://usethis.r-lib.org/) package

* We will discuss what pkgdown is and how to use it

* We will provide additional references including tutorials for adding Travis to a repo that does contain a package

## Travis CI 

* What is **Travis**? Is this a person? Why is everyone talking about Travis???

* Have you ever heard someone say that they used Travis to test their package?
  Who is this amazing code guru?!

### Allow me to introduce you
```{r, echo = FALSE, out.width="20%"}
knitr::include_graphics(here::here("figures/travis-mascot.png"))
```

* Turns out Travis is not a person after all, although there is a pretty awesome mascot that looks like a person.

&nbsp;


* Check [here](https://blog.travis-ci.com/2013-07-17-introducing-travis-our-new-mascot) if you want to know more about why Travis is called Travis

### What Travis CI really is...

* This was actually a company in Berlin, Germany that was founded in 2001 that was recently acquired by Idera.

&nbsp;


* It is really a **Continuous Integration**  and **Continuous Deployment** platform.

&nbsp;
&nbsp;

---

### What is Continuous Integration?

* [Continuous Integration (CI)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continuous_integration#Software) is "the practice of merging all developer's copies to a shared mainline several times a day"
 
 *like pushing your code to the master branch on GitHub regularly

&nbsp;
&nbsp;

---

### How Continuous Integration works?
* Typically programmers build their code and complete tests on their code before they commit

&nbsp;


* **Build** meaning: "the process of converting the human-readable source artifacts into machine-readable artifacts" according to [users on stackoverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/1622506/programming-definitions-what-exactly-is-building)
  + rendering
  + generating reports
  + compilation etc.

                   ***Travis helps automate this process***
&nbsp;
&nbsp;

---

### What is Continuous Delivery / Deployment?

* Basically you are getting your code ready to be deployed at all times - ie it can build without issues.

&nbsp;

* Travis-CI can directly link to GitHub - thus it can also deliver or deploy websites of your code through GitHub/GitHub pages. We will talk more about that later.

### How Travis works

* [travis-build](https://GitHub.com/travis-ci/travis-build) uses the .travis.yml file that must be in your root project directory to create a bash script to run be run in the build environment by [travis-worker](https://GitHub.com/travis-ci/worker)

[ref](https://GitHub.com/travis-ci/travis-ci)

&nbsp;

### Does Travis also work on private repos?

Yes, Travis CI works on private and public projects!

&nbsp;
&nbsp;

---

## Lets add Travis to our repos!

* We will show you how to add Travis CI to a repo without a package.

&nbsp;

* If you have a package look at one of these other tutorials:
https://docs.travis-ci.com/user/tutorial/
https://GitHub.com/lcolladotor/r-travis
https://GitHub.com/craigcitro/r-travis/wiki
https://neuroconductor.org/tutorials/getting_ready_for_submission

&nbsp;

* Adding Travis CI to a package can be a tad easier/faster with the right tools.

&nbsp;
&nbsp;

---

### How do we do this? step 1: sign up/sign in to travis-ci

```{r, echo = FALSE, out.width="100%"}
knitr::include_graphics(here::here("figures/login_travis.png"))
```

&nbsp;
&nbsp;

---

### How do we do this? step2: activate GitHub repos
```{r, echo = FALSE, out.width="80%"}
knitr::include_graphics(here::here("figures/activate.png"))
```

&nbsp;
&nbsp;

---

### Organization repo activation
```{r, echo = FALSE, out.width="100%"}
knitr::include_graphics(here::here("figures/activate_org_repo.png"))
```

&nbsp;
&nbsp;

---

### How do we do this? step 3: create a .travis.yml file 

```{r, echo = FALSE, out.width="40%"}
knitr::include_graphics(here::here("figures/leo_derfinder_yml.png"))
#https://GitHub.com/lcolladotor/r-travis/blob/master/sample.travis.yml
```

&nbsp;

Commit and push to GitHub!!

&nbsp;

For more details on what to include see [here](https://GitHub.com/craigcitro/r-travis/wiki#configuration-options)
and [here](https://support.rstudio.com/hc/en-us/articles/200486518-Customizing-Package-Build-Options).

&nbsp;
&nbsp;

---

### Our .travis.yml file for our repo that doesn't have a package
```{r, echo = FALSE, out.width="50%"}
knitr::include_graphics(here::here("figures/case_study_yml.png"))
```

&nbsp;
&nbsp;

---

### Our DESCRIPTION file
* In our case we are adding travis to repos that are not packages
* But we still need to have a description file with info about our dependencies, authors, etc. even if just placeholders

&nbsp;

```{r, echo = FALSE, out.width="38%"}
knitr::include_graphics(here::here("figures/case_study_DESCRIPTION.png"))
```

&nbsp;
&nbsp;

---

### Add GitHub package dependencies
&nbsp;
Manually add a field called "Remotes" specifying where the package is on GitHub
```{r, echo = FALSE, out.width="38%"}
knitr::include_graphics(here::here("figures/GitHub_pkg_description.png"))

```

&nbsp;
&nbsp;

---

### Add Travis badge

&nbsp;

1. Go to the desired activated repository where you added .travis.yml and/or DESCRIPTION files
2. Click the build gray button
3. Select Markdown format
4. Copy and paste the result into your README file

```{r, echo = FALSE, out.width="60%"}
knitr::include_graphics(here::here("figures/addingbadge.png"))
```

&nbsp;
&nbsp;

---

## Trouble shooting
* If your repo fails, you can modify your files and then run the test again. 
* Look at your errors to see what went wrong.
```{r, echo = FALSE, out.width="50%"}
knitr::include_graphics(here::here("figures/restartbuild.png"))
knitr::include_graphics(here::here("figures/errors.png"))
```

&nbsp;
&nbsp;

---

### If Travis didn't seem to run a build - check requests for more information.
```{r, echo = FALSE, out.width="75%"}
knitr::include_graphics(here::here("figures/Troubleshooting.png"))
```

&nbsp;
&nbsp;

---

## pkgdown
* pkgdown allows you to create a website of your repo
* Here is an example:
https://crunch.io/r/crplyr/
```{r, echo = FALSE, out.width="80%"}
knitr::include_graphics(here::here("figures/pkgdownex.png"))
```

&nbsp;
&nbsp;

---

### Go to GitHub repo settings and select the desired branch as source
```{r, echo = FALSE, out.width="80%"}
knitr::include_graphics(here::here("figures/GitHubpages.png"))
```

&nbsp;
&nbsp;

---

### Create _pkgdown.yml and if you haven't yet and a .Rbuildignore file

```{r, echo = FALSE, out.width="80%"}
knitr::include_graphics(here::here("figures/_pkgdown.yml.png"))

knitr::include_graphics(here::here("figures/Rbuildignore.png"))

```

&nbsp;
&nbsp;

---

### Build and check your website

* Commit and push all your changes!

* Your website URL is the one listed in your GitHub settings
```{r, echo = FALSE, out.width="80%"}
knitr::include_graphics(here::here("figures/GitHubpagesurl.png"))
```

* For more info check [here](https://usethis.r-lib.org/reference/use_pkgdown.html).

&nbsp;
&nbsp;

---

## Alternative Faster Method
You can also create only the DESCRIPTION file manually, then use the usethis package to create the other necessary files

```{r, echo = TRUE, eval = FALSE}
library(usethis)
usethis::use_readme_rmd() 
# if you only have an README.md file
# this will also add the travis badge
# make sure you update the .md and .Rmd files!
usethis::use_travis() 
# this will create the .travis.yml file
# this will also pull up https://travis-ci.org to allow you activate this repo easily
usethis::use_pkgdown() 
# this will create .Rbuildignore and _pkdown.yml files
```

&nbsp;

## Additional Info
* The [wikipedia page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Travis_CI) has additional information on Travis CI in general.

* This [link](https://medium.com/@zbbergma/using-travisci-for-continuous-integration-to-GitHub-organizations-9ad1d96bd624) will tell you more about how Travis CI works.

* Remember you can use the [usethis package](https://www.rdocumentation.org/packages/usethis/versions/1.5.0/topics/use_pkgdown) to easily use pkgdown and travis for a package. This did not work as easily in our case as we were adding Travis CI and pkgdown to repos without a package. Here is a great [tutorial](https://neuroconductor.org/tutorials/getting_ready_for_submission).

* Here is a [list](https://docs.travis-ci.com/user/common-build-problems/#my-build-fails-unexpectedly) of common build problems.
